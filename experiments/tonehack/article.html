                        <li>What timbre really is (a.k.a texture of a sound; the thing that makes you distinguish between a violin and a guitar).</li>
                        <li>Why certain timbres sound nicer than others.</li>
                        <li>How the basis of timbre is also the basis of chords (i.e. major, minor, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Why certain chords sound nicer than others.</li>

                    <h3>Creating a pure tone with a simplified string model</h3>
                    <p>A tight string that is fixed at both ends vibrates when plucked.</p>
                    
                    <p>Below is a simplified, imaginary string. Let's assume that our simplified string wobbles up and down continuously when plucked, at a constant rate.</p>
                    <div id='simple-string' class='string' style='float: left;'></div>
                    <div style='float: left; width: 500px; margin-left: 20px;'>
                        <p>The resulting vibration that this up-down motion produces is a sine wave. For this particular example, the frequency of the sound is set to 220Hz.</p>
                        <p>If such a string could exist in the physical world, this is what you would actually hear. A pure 220Hz sine wave, in sound form.</p>

                    <div class='clear'></div>
                    <p>Let's add one layer of realism.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Overtones (or <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance'>resonant frequencies</a>)</h3>
                    <p>One way to think of a vibrating string is to think of it as having energy trapped in it. Similar to a capacitor that fills up with electric charge which slowly gets relased, a string stores the kinetic energy that is transferred into it by a pluck.</p>
                    <p>With the tension built up on the string by pulling it up or down, a quick release of the string puts all sorts of random movement pattenrs into the string. Most of these movements quickly dissipate, except for the movements that have self-propagating properties. For some speeds, the result of a move in the string, as it is releasing the built up tension, ends up re-creating the same tension in the opposite direction. This causes a cycle in which the string keeps going back and forth. This is called a vibration. It is also called a resonant frequency. Resonance is when energy is trapped in an object in the form of a continuous vibration.</p>
                    <p>A string can have many resonant frequencies. </p>
