				<h3>things I do</h3>
				<p>Coder, Linux sys admin, interface designer. Can also interface with humans.</p>
				<h3>education</h3>
				<p>UBC Computer Engineering (Software option)<br />5 months of the 4 years spent abroad in Uppsala, Sweden</p>
				<h3>full time work</h3>
				<p>I loved working at <a href='http://www.invokemedia.com/'>Invoke Media</a> for a while, then moved to <a href='http://www.athinkingape.com/'>A Thinking Ape</a>, where my responsibilities mostly revolve around leading the development of internal tools.</p>
				<h3>current side projects</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Bus schedule interface for Vancouver (runs on Django.) <a href='http://takethebus.in/vancouver'>view working version here</a></li>
					<li>The drawing game, as me and my friends call it. (I wanted to play with html canvas. Although <a href='http://www.doodleordie.com/'>someone else</a> made pretty much the exact same thing)</li>
					<li>Chord progression builder. (The lack of music theory visualization software out there made me think maybe I should give it a try.)</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>skill set</h3>
                <span class='subtitle'>programming</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Currently enjoying poetic Python with Django.</li>
                    <li>Pretty experienced with PHP. CodeIgniter is my favorite framework (because it lets <em>me</em> do the coding), however i've also used Zend, Cake and perhaps others I may have forgotten about. Bit of experience with Wordpress and Drupal.</li>
                    <li>I know, and dislike Java. Few friends whom I respect have convinced me that it's not so bad though.</li>
                    <li>Ruby, but I don't get why people use it other than to attend startup meetings without feeling left out. I only learned it to write <a href='http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=93907'>an Amarok script</a> which I used for personal convenience.</li>
                    <li>I once used Perl long time ago for a regex-heavy script I wrote (i was scraping my school's bookstore database for my <a href='http://ubcbook.com'>book exchange website</a>)</li>
                    <li>I wish I had more experience with C and C++, I haven't touched them since school. Most f<span class='fade'>(r)</span>u<span class='fade'>(stratio)</span>n i've had with C++ was in my parallel programming course (pthreads, open mpi, etc) VHDL was also fun.</li>
                    <li>I overthink variable/function names and enjoy spending time looking for better ways of doing certain tasks (i have a good intuitive sense for guessing what else could be out there). My code is clean, concise and maintainable and hence it rarely needs long explanatory comments.  <a href='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris'>Laziness</a> pays off.</li>
                    <li>If you judge how good a coder I am by asking me to name some design patterns, we might not get along.</li>
                </ul>
                <span class='subtitle'>server side software configuration</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>apache (vhosts, ssl, mod_php, mod_wsgi, mod_rewrite, etc.)</li>
                    <li>ssh (fail2ban, denyhosts)</li>
                    <li>postfix (and mail-related DNS best practices)</li>
                    <li>cron jobs</li>
                    <li>database management (well, just MySQL nothing fancy)</li>
                    <li>HAProxy</li>
                    <li>monitoring tools (monit, munin)</li>
                    <li class='fade'>list goes on, you get the idea.</li>
                </ul>
                <span class='subtitle'>web front-end development</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean html with meaningful markup (id's and classes indicate what the elements are - not how they look.)</li>
                    <li>Compatible css that degrades gracefully with browsers that have down syndrome</li>
                    <li>Responsive javascript interactivity with jQuery. Other than that, I try to avoid heavy and bloaty libraries at all costs.</li>
                    <li>I am especially skilled at understanding the needs of the user, and designing the interface around their priorities. Half of the interface design process is talking to those who will be using it, and the other half is iterating over the designs according to feedback and analytics.</li>
                </ul>
                <span class='subtitle'>person</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ggenerally chill</li>
                    <li>Sensitive to bs</li>
                </ul>
				<h3>temporary positions</h3>
                <span class='subtitle'>custom application developer (Gain Communications)</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Upgraded their ancient database management tools to a custom web interface that I wrote, which automated all sorts of conversions, calculations and pdf report generations.</li>
                    <li>Gained valuable experience in asking the right questions such to understand the (technically unsavvy) clients' needs, communicate possible solutions, and plan out feasible roadmaps.</li>
                </ul>
                <span class='subtitle'>computer specialist at a research lab (Bilkent University Computational Electromagnetics)</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helped install and maintain Linux servers and software. (Rocks cluster distribution)</li>
                    <li>First time I touched a high performance computer cluster. Setting up the PCI-E infiniband network was exciting.</li>

				</ul>
				<h3>also</h3>

					<li>ssh is vital to my survival</li>
					<li>This resume is nongermane.</li>
