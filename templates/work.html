                <p>
                    Coder, UNIX system administrator, product &amp; interface designer. Can also interface with people.<br />
                    Skilled and experienced in every aspect of product development including DevOps, UX design, management, training, recruiting, and of course, programming.
                </p>
                <h3>work</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I taught as a senior instructor at <a href='http://lighthouselabs.ca'>Lighthouse Labs</a> (Nov 2013 - Nov 2015), which is a two-month coding bootcamp. Education reform in action.</li>
                    <li>I founded <a href='http://probablymurat.com'>Probably Murat Inc.</a>, where I often hire Lighthouse graduates to my contract projects.</li>
                    <li>I partnered with <a href='http://ceo.ca'>CEO.CA</a> and founded <a href='https://chat.ceo.ca'>chat.ceo.ca</a></li>
                    <li>I am a technical advisor/consultant at <a href='http://food.ee'>Foodee</a>, <a href='http://quiet.ly'>Quietly</a> and <a href='http://stagedocs.com'>Stagedocs</a>.</li>
                    <li>I was employed full-time at <a href='http://quiet.ly'>Quietly</a>, <a href='http://www.invokemedia.com/'>Invoke Media</a> (creators of HootSuite) and <a href='http://www.athinkingape.com/'>A Thinking Ape</a> in the past couple years.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>side projects</h3>
                <p>I usually have several hobby projects going, feel free to see some polished ones at <a href='{% url make %}'>make section</a>, and some less presentable ones on <a href='http://github.com/mayfer/'>my Github</a>.</p>
                <p>I play drums in the local Vancouver band, <a href='https://swim-team.bandcamp.com'>Swim Team</a></p>
                <h3>programming skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Currently Python is my favorite, but I work mostly in JavaScript. In the past, I've worked with most of the popular languages such as PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, C++, etc. I have a solid understanding of how a computer works, and have no problem working with low level languages.</li>
                    <li>I know my way around language docs quite well, and jumping onto projects with languages I'm not familiar with is never a problem, other than perhaps slowing me down.</li>
                    <li>I enjoy spending time looking for better ways of doing things. I have a good intuition for knowing what is possible, what is feasible, and what is not. My code is clean, concise and maintainable and hence it rarely needs long explanatory comments. I dislike repetitive typing, so I try to come up with generic solutions. <a href='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris'>Laziness</a> pays off.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>sys admin skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong hands-on knowledge of Linux and the web (filesystems, users/permissions, memory/process/thread management, TCP/IP &amp; network layers (OSI model), DNS, SSL, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, DigitalOcean). I was an early adopter of Amazon EC2 in 2008.</li>
                    <li>Web servers (nginx, Apache)</li>
                    <li>Distributed real-time applications (especially using Node and Redis)</a>
                    <li>Security and authentication (iptables, fail2ban, denyhosts, LDAP, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Database management (mostly MySQL, bit of PostgreSQL, MariaDB, master-slave &amp; multi-master replication, AWS RDS)</li>
                    <li>Distributed system design and implementation (service-based web architecture)</li>
                    <li>Load balancing (HAProxy, AWS load balancers)</li>
                    <li>Monitoring tools (monit, munin, nagios)</li>
                    <li>Deployment and automation tools</li>
                    <li>Version control best practices for very large teams</li>
                    <li>Virtualization and cloud environments (KVM, VirtualBox, Parallels, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Mail servers (Postfix and mail-related DNS best practices)</li>
                    <li>Scalable data analysis with Hadoop</li>
                    <li>Use of CDN's for high availability content</li>
                    <li class='fade'>list goes on, you get the idea.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>front-end design</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean HTML with meaningful markup (ID's and classes indicate what the elements are - not how they look.)</li>
                    <li>Compatible CSS that degrades gracefully with browsers that have down syndrome</li>
                    <li>Ability to design clean Javascript architectures. I try to avoid heavy and bloaty libraries.</li>
                    <li>I am especially skilled at understanding the needs of the user, and designing the interface around their priorities. Half of the interface design process is talking to those who will be using it, and the other half is iterating over the designs according to personal taste, feedback and analytics.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>person</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally chill</li>
                    <li>Sensitive to BS</li>
                    <li>Confident at talking to clients</li>
                    <li>Skilled at explaining technical concepts to technically-challenged people in simple terms</li>
                    <li>I wouldn't ever want to separate work and humour</li>
                    <li>I try to stay physically, socially, musically and artistically active. Unplugging on a near-daily basis is essential for sanity</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>education</h3>
                <p>UBC Computer Engineering (Software option)<br />I spent 5 months of the 4 years in Uppsala Universitet, Sweden</p>
                <h3>also</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Given any problem or project, google and time is all I need. It would be great to have people and <a href='http://last.fm/user/muratayfer'>music</a> as well though.</li>
                    <li><code>ssh</code> is vital to my survival.</li>
                </ul>
