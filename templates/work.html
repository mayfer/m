                </p>
                <h3>full time work</h3>
                <p>I loved working at <a href='http://www.invokemedia.com/'>Invoke Media</a> for a while, then moved to <a href='http://www.athinkingape.com/'>A Thinking Ape</a>, where my responsibilities mostly revolve around leading the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps'>dev ops</a> team.</p>
                <p>These days I do a mix of coding, code reviewing, training, managing, cleaning &amp; polishing.</p>
                <h3>side projects</h3>
                <p>Please see the <a href='{% url make %}'>make section</a>.</p>
                <h3>programming skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>My comfort zone is poetic Python with Django. By far my favorite web programming setup.</li>
                    <li>Javascript is useful and fun and <a href='http://wtfjs.com/'>retarded</a> and I've been making good friends with it lately.</li>
                    <li>I used to do PHP. Nowadays I can afford to refuse that, thankfully. But if you must know, CodeIgniter was my favorite framework (because it let <em>me</em> do the coding), however i've used many others.</li>
                    <li>I know, and dislike Java, due to its wordy and bureaucratic feel. Few friends whom I respect have convinced me that it's not so bad though.</li>
                    <li>Ruby, but I often get confused as to why people use it other than to attend startup meetings without feeling left out. I learned it to write <a href='http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=93907'>an Amarok script</a> which I used for personal convenience, before Spotify came along...</li>
                    <li>I once used Perl long time ago for a regex-heavy script I wrote (i was scraping my school's bookstore database for my <a href='http://ubcbook.com'>book exchange website</a>)</li>
                    <li>I wish I had more experience with C and C++, I haven't touched them since school. Most f<span class='fade'>r</span>u<span class='fade'>stratio</span>n i've had with C++ was in my parallel programming course (pthreads, open mpi, etc). </li>
                    <li>I enjoy spending time looking for better ways of doing certain tasks. I have a good intuition for guessing what is possible, and what is not. My code is clean, concise and maintainable and hence it rarely needs long explanatory comments. I dislike repetitive typing, so I try to come up with generic solutions. <a href='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris'>Laziness</a> pays off.</li>
                    <li>I would prefer it if you didn't ask me which design patterns I know. Just, don't.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>sys admin skills</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scalable data analysis with Hadoop</li>
                    <li>Apache (vhosts, SSL, mod_php, mod_wsgi, mod_rewrite, etc.)</li>
                    <li><code>sshd</code> (fail2ban, denyhosts, LDAP, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Postfix (and mail-related DNS best practices)</li>
                    <li>Cron jobs</li>
                    <li>Database management (well, mostly MySQL, bit of PostgreSQL, nothing fancy)</li>
                    <li>Distributed system design (service-based web architecture)</li>
                    <li>HAProxy</li>
                    <li>Monitoring tools (monit, munin, nagios)</li>
                    <li><code>git</code>, gitolite, and the good old obsolete Subversion</li>
                    <li>Virtualization and cloud environments (KVM, VirtualBox, Parallels, etc.)</li>
                    <li class='fade'>list goes on, you get the idea.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>front-end design</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clean HTML with meaningful markup (ID's and classes indicate what the elements are - not how they look.)</li>
                    <li>Compatible CSS that degrades gracefully with browsers that have down syndrome</li>
                    <li>Responsive javascript interactivity with jQuery. Other than that, I try to avoid heavy and bloaty libraries.</li>
                    <li>I am especially skilled at understanding the needs of the user, and designing the interface around their priorities. Half of the interface design process is talking to those who will be using it, and the other half is iterating over the designs according to personal taste, feedback and analytics.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>person</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generally chill</li>
                    <li>Sensitive to BS</li>
                    <li>Confident at talking to clients</li>
                    <li>Skilled at explaining technical concepts to technically-challenged people in simple terms</li>
                    <li>I wouldn't ever want to separate work and humor</li>
                    <li>I try to stay physically, socially and musically active. Unplugging on a near-daily basis is essential for sanity</li>
                    <li>I value good taste and curiosity more than anything else in my peers, and can only hope that I live up to it myself.</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>education</h3>
                <p>UBC Computer Engineering (Software option)<br />I spent 5 months of the 4 years in Uppsala, Sweden</p>
                <h3>also</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>First program I wrote was a calculator in Visual Basic when I was twelve.</li>
                    <li>First useful program I wrote was a bash script that installed persistent live Ubuntu onto USB flash drives. This was before there were GUI installers. Credit goes to fdisk and Ubuntu, not me.</li>
                    <li>Given any problem or project, google and time is all I need. It would be great to have people and music as well though.</li>
                    <li><code>ssh</code> is vital to my survival.</li>
                </ul>
